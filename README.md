# HealthCare Disease Prediction

This project uses a machine learning model to predict possible diseases based on food, nutrition, and lifestyle data.

## Dataset
- **Food_and_Nutrition.csv**: Contains features such as age, gender, height, weight, activity level, dietary preference, nutritional intake, and disease labels.

## How to Use

1. **Install Requirements**
   - Make sure you have Python 3.x installed.
   - Install required libraries:
     ```bash
     pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn
     ```

2. **Run the Jupyter Notebook**
   - Open `health_care_disease.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab.
   - Follow the step-by-step instructions in the notebook to:
     - Load and preprocess the data
     - Train a machine learning model
     - Evaluate and use the model for disease prediction

## Project Structure
- `Food_and_Nutrition.csv` - The dataset
- `health_care_disease.ipynb` - Jupyter notebook for model training and prediction
- `README.md` - Project documentation

## Example Usage
See the notebook for example code to train and use the model.
